                            <p class="lead">The clever application of social engineering tactics will assist in both
                                bypassing technologically difficult to overcome barriers to entry, as well to aid in
                                gaining
                                access overall. Using methods that elicit an emotional response,
                                such as the threat that money will be deducted from the users credit card or bank
                                account,
                                and urging the user to "act now" or lose money. Likewise, if the target is presented
                                with
                                confidential information or information not
                                meant for them, they may be urged to click through warnings. In general, when an
                                emotional
                                response is elicited, common sense and safe practice may be dropped by the target. It
                                may be
                                simpler than that, and the target may only
                                have to be convinced to enable macros in an office document for a mundane reason such as
                                to
                                sign the document. One of the best social engineering attempts I have seen was a faked
                                social media account, set up to mimic a person
                                working in the targets same industry, the target received a direct message saying "Have
                                you
                                seen what people are saying about you on these professional forums? Yes, here is a link
                                to
                                the forum, log in with your email address
                                and password." The target was suspicious and avoided the trap, but this is a good
                                example of
                                the clever application of social engineering eliciting an emotional response and urging
                                a
                                target to "act now".

                            <h2 class="display-6">Spearphishing with Malicious Files - Basics</h2>

                            <p class="lead">Attack <em>vectors</em> refer to the means of payload delivery, ie: the
                                spearphishing methodology (.LNK file, malicious MS Office Word or Excel macros), while
                                the
                                attack
                                <em>payload</em> refers to the actual code or script that will run (usually as a dropper
                                at
                                this stage of the engagement, can also be part of a file-less attack through process
                                hollowing), such as a COM object, C# delivery,
                                and XSL stylesheet, and many, many more. The basic VBA techniques we will demonstrate
                                now are easily detected by
                                AV and EDR, we will use them to illustrate the basics of how one type of script can be
                                used to download or open
                                another script. For example, the VBA command "Shell" can be used to execute a powershell
                                script that will use UrlDownload to
                                download a program from somewhere else, in the following example we will use a simple
                                VBA macro in a word document to execute Ncat.exe
                                as a reverse shell. Remember that social engineering is required to push a user to
                                interact with a document and enable macros, remember that AV
                                will <em>automatically be triggered as an alert to any Auto_Open or Auto_run of any
                                    macro inside a document</em>, given the long
                                history of malicious macros being used as an attack vector, this is to be expected.
                                One way of defeating spam filters is to deliver the payload via a DropBox or OneDrive
                                link.
                                To ensure the file is immediately downloaded and preview is bypassed, make sure the end
                                of the link is changed from "dl=0" to "dl=1" (this technique works the same using links
                                from OneDrive, DropBox, and Google Cloud) - <strong>ie:

                                a simple set of Powershell commands
                                inside the VBA command "Shell" to download and execute a powershell script: Shell

                                Remember to use double backslashes in your filepath when modifying the python script
                                (single backslashes are interpreted as a newline character).
                                In this command we use the New-Object PowerShell cmdlet to create a .NET web object
                                and make the use of the DownloadString function from the 
                                Net.WebClient class to download our malicious PowerShell script,

                            social engineering is
                            generally required to overcome certain technical obstacles.
